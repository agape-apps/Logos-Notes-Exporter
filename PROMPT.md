FEATURE XAML to MARKDOWN: Improve conversion of Tabs found at the beginning of lines

- Currently tabs **on the start of lines** will be shown as code (in many Markdown readers).
This is not a desirable behaviour as the user of Logos would not expect that

- Therefore Convert the tabs **on the start of lines** to Indents instead

- Use the existing indent setting as chosen by the user
  - If blockquotes is set use blockquotes (the default), if the user set nbsp with spaces for indents then this will be used.

- Each consecutive Tab will be converted to one indent 

- If there are more then six tabs, ignore the rest

- Make no changes to tabs in the middle of lines

Create todos and implement the feature

### EXAMPLES: (using `/t` to illustrate tabs and the default indent setting) 

**original first line, Markdown second line**

/t/t/tStart of Text with some other tabs for formatting /t 100 /t 200 /t 300
>>>Start of Text with some other tabs for formatting /t 100 /t 200 /t 300   

/tThis sentence has only one tab in front
>/This sentence has only one tab in front  

Here the tab is /t in the middle - therefore no change
Here the tab is /t in the middle - therefore no change  

/t/t/t/t/t/tHere we have six tabs that turn into 6 indents
>>>>>>Here we have six tabs that turn into 6 indents

/t/t/t/t/t/t/t/tHere we have eight tabs that turn into 6 indents
>>>>>>Here we have eight tabs that turn into 6 indents
